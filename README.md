# üõ°Ô∏è InsuranceHouse

**InsuranceHouse** is a university project that implements a secure, HTTPS-enabled web-based insurance management system using Spring Boot, Angular, and MySQL. The system is divided into two applications: one for clients and one for administrators. It supports user registration, two-factor authentication (with a verification code sent via email), policy browsing and purchase, as well as administrative control over users and services. Key features include Single Sign-On (SSO), Stripe sandbox payment integration, PDF policy generation, and real-time security and system monitoring, including logging of extremely large payments and multiple failed login attempts.

## üè† Authentication
Users of the application first register, then log in, after which a verification code is sent to their email to be entered as part of two-factor authentication. Administrator can additionally log in using Single Sign-On (SSO), which also grants access to the client application without requiring a separate login.
